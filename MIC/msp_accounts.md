- **What are these accounts?**

These accounts are the official Microsoft Student Partner Office 365 accounts which should be used
for everything related to MSP. After first receiving the account with the default password, you have
90 days to log in and change your password, otherwise you will lose the account. You can log into
your account <first_name.last_name@studentpartner.com> (e.g. john.smith@studentpartner.com) at https://mail.office365.com

- **What can you do with these accounts?**
  
With the MSP account you can access Microsft subscriptions for various products (Windows 10, Visual Studio, Office)
which you can access by logging in at https://my.visualstudio.com. However, with great power comes great responsability.
Those licenses are very well tracked, and if any suspicious behaviour is noticed (e.g. selling them on-line) they will be revoked.

Also you have access to 150 USD/month in Azure to use as you wish. You can access this by logging in at https://portal.azure.com/

- **What these accounts should be used for?**

These accounts should be used for anything related to MSP (e.g. sending e-mails for Academy related work).
