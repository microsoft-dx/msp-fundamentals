# Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary in order to activate your Azure for Students package. In order for this to work, you will need to have your university email account handy, so that the fact that you are indeed a student can be verified.

# Landing on the appropriate page
To kick it off, start by following [the link here.][azure-sign-up]
You will arrive on a page from which you can begin the activation process.
Click on the green `Activate now` button, as it can be seen in the following image.

# Signing in
You will now be asked to sign in. Here you can either stick strictly to your university email address if it happens to be a Microsoft one or use your personal Microsoft account instead and verify your status through a verification email sent to your university email address.
## Signing up
If you do no currently have a Microsoft account, you can create one by going to [the following link.][microsoft-sign-up]
## Verifying status
If you chose to use your personal Microsoft account, you will be greeted with the following form.

Now it's time to input your university email address followed by clicking on the `Verify and claim your offer` button, as shown in the image below.

After clicking the button, you will receive an email on your university address containing a link through which you can continue the activation process.

# Filling in the details
The following form will have you input some of your info, such as your `First name`, `Last name`, and `Email address for important notifications` (which in my case were already completed), as well as your `Phone` number. You can skip the `Company VatID` field. Please note that, if you so desire, you can choose an email address different than the one you used to sign in at the beginning of this guide.

# Phone verification
You will now be required to verify your identity through a phone numer. Input a phone number in the appropiate box and choose either of `Text me` or `Call me` depending on the way you'd like to be reached for reception of the verification code.

Once you hit one of the buttons, you will be prompted for the aforementioned code which you hopefully received and can input in order to proceed to the next step.
